<h1>Project 1 Software Instructions</h1>

For the most part I wrote my own code as adaptations of the different project we did in class (ENGI 301) with Professor Welsh. 
or example I adapted the codes for the Button, ht16k33,  SPI screen.

The different Software Drivers are: Motor, Button, SPI_Screen. One additional driver that wil need to ne implemented is one that Drives the 
Hall Effect Sensor to calibrate the stepper motors to start from a known position every time.

Libraries used: <libraries>

Make sure that you have the Motor, Button and SPI_Screen drivers in known folders. Then run the main code using the absolute file location addresses of the different drivers.
